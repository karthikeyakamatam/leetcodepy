1. the question given is to find the best way for selling a stock and buying a stock.
e.g:  Input: prices[] = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4}
Output: 5
Explanation:6-1

code in python:
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        min_price = prices[0]
        max_profit = 0
        
        for price in prices[1:]:
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            else:
                max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
        
        return max_profit
explantion:
here we take list of prices as input from various days.
1.if there are no prices reurn the 0
2. intlize the min price with the first day price
3.intilize the max profitwith 0
4. use for loop to iterate through the loop start from second element in price list
5.if that day price is less than preivous day then update the min price
6.else find the max profit by finding max of the preexisting maxprofit and thatday price and min_price
7.return the profit
